# Mono ChaseCam
This is a free-to-use HTML/javascript based overlay for roleplay streamers. Basically it mimics the overlay of the MOTOROLA VB400 bodycam.

inspired from [XION-ChaseCam](https://github.com/zhivotnoya/XION-ChaseCam)



# How to use:

1) create a directory for the script to reside

2) put files (including this one) into that directory

3) load into OBS (or other software) as a "BROWSER SOURCE" the file with the .html extension

5) activate the layer and profit!
